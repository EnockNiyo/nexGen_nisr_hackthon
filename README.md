   - Forecast unemployment trends across regions and demographics using machine learning models.
   
2. **Tailored Interventions**: 
   - Generate actionable recommendations to bridge skills gaps and align with labor market needs.
   
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: 
   - Evaluate the impact of interventions through an interactive dashboard, enabling continuous refinement.
